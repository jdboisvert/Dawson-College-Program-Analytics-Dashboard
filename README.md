# Dawson-College-Program-Analytics-Dashboard-

## Overview: 

The purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding of web scrapping and to work on a personal summer project. The goal of this project is to scrap all the programs from the Programs page on the Dawson College website (https://www.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/programs) and build a simple analytics dashboard based on the data found. This project will be loosely based around a Udemy course I took about web scraping and dashboarding with Python (credit here: https://www.udemy.com/simple-blogging-analytics-dashboard-in-python/). 

### The dashboard should contain: 
-	Number of programs
-	Number of profiles per program
-	Number of disciplines per program
-	Number of Special Fields of studies 
-	When page was last modified 
-	Possible ranking of programs with most information on website (Ranking Algorithm?)
